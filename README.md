![App Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbidHasanRafi/LeafXplain-Lite/main/assets/app_header.png)

**LeafXplain-Lite** is a smart, explainable AI-based web application for real-time plant disease detection. It provides intuitive visualizations, interpretable model outputs, and expert treatment suggestions through Gemini AI â€” all in one lightweight package.


## Features at a Glance

### Image-Based Disease Analysis
- Upload a leaf image to get a fast and accurate disease diagnosis.
- Powered by a CNN model with attention mechanisms and Grad-CAM explanations.
- Visualizes which part of the leaf influenced the model's decision.


## App Walkthrough

### Diagnosis Overview â€“ Instant Summary

When an image is uploaded, the app provides a quick summary of predictions, including:
- predicted disease
- Grad-Cam Visuals
- Predicted Result

### Detailed Analysis â€“ Interpretability & Insights

This section breaks down the prediction with clear, scientific visualizations:
- **Original Image**: What you uploaded.
- **Attention Heatmap**: Shows what the model is focusing on.
- **Class Activation Map (CAM)**: Highlights influential image regions.
- **Prediction Distribution**: Probability scores for each class.

## Model Details

### Architecture

```python
class PlantDiseaseCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(PlantDiseaseCNN, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            # Additional layers...
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )
```


## Supported Plant Diseases
