## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Google Generative AI SDK

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leafxplain-lite.git
cd leafxplain-lite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

1. **Gemini API Key**:
   - Obtain a Google Gemini API key
   - Add it to the app either:
     - Directly in the code (for testing)
     - Via Streamlit secrets (recommended for production)

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use the provided model or upload your own trained `.pth` file
   - The UI supports easy model switching

## Usage Guide

### Image Analysis Mode
1. Upload a trained model file (.pth)
2. Select "Upload Image" mode
3. Choose a plant leaf image
4. View results across three tabs:
   - **Diagnosis Overview**: Quick results and top predictions
   - **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive visualizations
   - **Expert Advisory**: Gemini-generated recommendations

### Live Camera Mode
1. Upload a trained model file (.pth)
2. Select "Live Camera" mode
3. Allow camera access
4. View real-time detection results
5. Click "Get Expert Advice" for detailed recommendations

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
```python
class PlantDiseaseCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(PlantDiseaseCNN, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            # ... additional layers ...
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )
```

### Supported Diseases
The model currently detects 20 common plant diseases including:
- Apple Scab
- Tomato Late Blight
- Grape Black Rot
- Corn Common Rust
- Potato Early Blight
